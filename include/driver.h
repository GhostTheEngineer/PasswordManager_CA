/**
 * @brief Runs the main loop of the password manager.
 * 
 * This function handles the program's execution, including:
 * - Loading stored passwords from a file.
 * - Prompting the user for authentication (if not in debug mode).
 * - Displaying the main menu and processing user input.
 * - Managing password addition, deletion, and viewing.
 * - Writing updated password data back to the file before exiting.
 * 
 * The function maintains a loop where the user can interact with 
 * the password manager until they choose to exit.
 * 
 * @note In `DEBUG` mode, the encrypted password file is displayed 
 *       at startup, and authentication is skipped.
