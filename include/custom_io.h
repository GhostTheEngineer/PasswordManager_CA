/**
 * @class CustomIO
 * @brief Provides utility functions for input handling and file management.
 * 
 * The CustomIO class is responsible for managing user input validation and file operations. 
 * It includes methods for retrieving the executable's path, constructing save paths, and 
 * securely saving and loading encrypted key-value data. 
 * 
 * This class is designed to facilitate modular and reusable I/O handling, ensuring 
 * structured file management and robust input validation.
