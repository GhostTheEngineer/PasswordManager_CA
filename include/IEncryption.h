/**
 * @class IEncryption
 * @brief Interface for encryption and decryption operations.
 * 
 * The IEncryption interface defines a contract for implementing encryption and decryption functionality.
 * Any class that inherits from this interface must provide implementations for both `Encrypt` and `Decrypt` methods.
 * This interface is designed to allow flexible and consistent encryption strategies, such as HEX-based encryption,
 * AES encryption, or other algorithms, to be used interchangeably.
